<h2> Intro..</h2>

<p>
	Death note was really awsome anime worth watching.... not only does it help us concentrate takes our mind off things but later on help us in getting a better judjement about our daily affairs ....  more over it is too short for a tv series to be... 37 episodes with 20 mins per episode and too much a plot twist... and spoiler alert for further moving down

<h2> Episode 1-10</h2>
<p>
    Episode 1 to 10 basically is a bvreif description about the"death note"... what it is and its rules..
more over it is breif description about the characters in the series like the main character was the topper of the country japan ...like air 1 of india...
and also the main villian is a pritty intelligent man obviosoly he is to compete with the topper of japan...and both of them are at kind of similar groud here ..
