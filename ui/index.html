<h2> Intro..</h2>

<p>
	Death note was really awsome anime worth watching.... not only does it help us concentrate takes our mind off things but later on help us in getting a better judjement about our daily affairs ....  more over it is too short for a tv series to be... 37 episodes with 20 mins per episode and too much a plot twist... and spoiler alert for further moving down...
